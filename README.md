# My Dotfiles

Hello! These are my dotfiles. Feel free to look around :)

## Philosophy

My dotfiles embrace productivity and simplicity. This means learning and using default
configurations whenever possible. This results to minimal setup and keeps maintaining dotfiles easy.

## Aesthetics

Everything is themed to [Kanagawa](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim), at least for now.

[Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/) helps tremendously here, providing consistent theming across
applications and allowing for easy customization and theme switching when desired.

## My Workflow

Switching between workspaces using `super+1`, `super+2`, etc.
This single-window-per-workspace approach eliminates visual clutter and
helps maintaining focus. And if I need more than one window, I just do some keyboard shortcuts and
the tiling window manager does its magic.

Navigating between tabs within applications using `alt+1`, `alt+2`, etc., which is often already the
default behavior. The tmux multiplexer enables fuzzy session switching with `ctrl+s`,
while windows can be switched or created using the same familiar `alt+1`, `alt+2` pattern.

Using this workflow, allows me to consistently operate outside any application. For example, there is
no need for integrated terminals in applications like VSCode, Zed or Neovim. I can just switch do the
workspace running the terminal, or switch inside tmux, or just spawn a new terminal with `super+enter`.

Further my workflow is centered around tmux, the fish shell and many CLIs and TUIs.
